# agar-py

Implementing agar.io to run locally as a Python process. This will optimize for our model being able to hook into the game state and learn in rapid iterations.

### TODO

- [ ] Move with mouse? Could move in directions other than the 8 we currently support
- [ ] Split via space bar
- [ ] Shoot via `q` as we are currently using `w` for motion
- [ ] Killing viruses
- [ ] Viruses splitting agents which are signficantly larger than the virus
- [ ] Some sort of inertia for agent cell parts
- [ ] Recombining agent cell parts
- [ ] Smarter datastructure for checking collisions
- [ ] Eventually merge split cells back together
- [ ] Have some intertia to bring cells together
